1- üéØ Project Title/Headline
"Data-Driven Sales Management: Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard"
"Optimizing Sales Performance and Distribution Strategies through Advanced Visualization of Amazon Sales Data"

2- Short Description / Purpose
This project aims to analyze Amazon‚Äôs sales data to enhance sales management and support strategic decision-making. Using Power BI, the data undergoes an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process to uncover trends in revenue, profit, and product performance across different time periods. Visual dashboards highlight key metrics such as units sold, order priority, and regional performance. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships that can improve distribution efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profitability. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the project demonstrates the value of business intelligence tools in optimizing sales operations in a competitive market.

5- ‚úÖ Project Highlights  
  1-Business Problem
     ‚Ä¢  With increasing competition and rising operational costs, Amazon requires deeper insight into its sales performance to optimize distribution, reduce costs, and 
        increase profitability.
     ‚Ä¢  Lack of visibility into regional trends, item-level performance, and sales channel efficiency affects strategic decision-making.

       ‚Üí Aids in focusing marketing, logistics, and inventory efforts on high-performing areas and products.

‚Ä¢   How do different sales channels (Online vs. Offline) perform in terms of revenue and profit?
       ‚Üí Supports decisions on where to invest more: e-commerce platforms or physical channels.

‚Ä¢   What is the impact of order priority on delivery performance and profitability?
      ‚Üí Evaluates whether prioritizing urgent orders improves or reduces margins.

‚Ä¢   Why products or categories generate the highest profit relative to the units sold?
      ‚Üí Helps in refining product offerings and promotions to boost margins.

‚Ä¢   Are there any patterns or anomalies in the sales data that indicate operational inefficiencies or new opportunities?
      ‚Üí Enables proactive actions based on trends, outliers, or sudden changes in performance.


2- Goal of the Dashboard
    ‚Ä¢  To create an interactive, data-driven dashboard using Power BI that enables stakeholders to monitor sales trends, evaluate performance by product, region, and 
       channel, and uncover opportunities for growth and efficiency.

3- Walkthrough of Key Visuals
     ‚Ä¢  Monthly/Yearly Sales Trend Charts: Visualize revenue patterns over time to identify peak sales periods.
     ‚Ä¢  Region & Item Type Matrix: Compare revenue and profit across geographies and product categories.
     ‚Ä¢  Sales Channel Pie Chart: Analyze contribution of online vs. offline channels.
     ‚Ä¢  Profit vs. Units Sold Scatter Plot: Understand which items generate high returns.
     ‚Ä¢ KPI Cards: Display key metrics like Total Revenue, Profit, Units Sold, and Average Price.

4- Business Impact and Insights
     ‚Ä¢   Identified top-performing regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa) and high-profit products (e.g., Cosmetics).
     ‚Ä¢   Highlighted offline channels as more profitable, guiding resource allocation.
     ‚Ä¢   Revealed seasonal trends, aiding inventory and campaign planning.
     ‚Ä¢   Helped improve data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.
